In K-Wise, I created a hybrid engine with 3,200+ rules for real-time compatibility checking. I focus on privacy-first, cost-effective solutions that deliver measurable business value."

      "question": "Tell me about your best project",
      "answer": "AppliTrak is my flagship project—an enterprise job portal with automated resume-to-job matching using local AI. The system handles 60+ REST endpoints, multi-role authentication, and integrates 3 external job APIs. I'm most proud of reducing manual screening from 5-7 minutes to 30 seconds while maintaining 75% AI accuracy and zero cloud costs through local LLM processing."

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach performance optimization?",
      "answer": "I'm obsessive about performance because it directly impacts user experience. In K-Wise, I achieved <300ms response times through LRU caching, lazy loading for 1000+ images, and debounced API calls. I always measure impact with real metrics—like the 87% reduction in build time and 99.5% uptime. Performance isn't just about speed; it's about delivering value to users and businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your approach to backend development?",
      "answer": "I build enterprise-grade backends with Node.js and Express.js, focusing on RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, and RBAC systems. In AppliTrak, I architected 60+ endpoints with complete multi-role authentication. I design MongoDB schemas with proper indexing (including geospatial), implement aggregation pipelines for analytics, and ensure secure file handling for document parsing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain your technical proficiency?",
      "answer": "My overall technical proficiency is 82%, with strengths in JWT Authentication (92%), MongoDB (88%), API Integration (86%), Node.js (85%), and JavaScript (85%). I'm continually improving in AI Integration (75%) and React (78%). These numbers reflect my real-world project experience—for example, the 60+ REST endpoints in AppliTrak and 150+ API integrations in K-Wise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes you different from other developers?",
      "answer": "I focus on business impact, not just technical implementation. My projects show measurable results: 90% time reduction in AppliTrak, 85% consultation elimination in K-Wise, 87% build time improvement. I combine modern AI with practical solutions, prioritize privacy-first approaches, and always optimize for performance. I speak in metrics because numbers tell the real story of value delivered."
